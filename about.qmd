### Model Deployment

Developing a Machine Learning model is just the start. Making it usable across the company is another story. I've been interested on how to make

my machine learning models scalable and deployment ready. This includes, containerization, version control and CI/CD.

### Data Analytics

I love telling a story. Identifying patterns, discovering trends and interpreting it back to business is one of the main reason why I love Data Science! Making beautiful, informative and compelling presentation for me is the best part of interpreting your insight to the client.

### Data Engineering/Developing Automated ETL/Manual Task Automation

Automating Task and developing ETL is one of my favorite technical skills. Having the ability to cut down the time it took for a csv file to be downloaded by using python is the best for me! Extracting, Transforming, manipulating, cleaning and loading sets of data to form a stable pipeline is a work that I will never get tired of.
